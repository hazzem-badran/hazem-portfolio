    description: `During my studies at Ras Al-Naqoura School within
                              the CAN program, I focused not only on the
                              academic side but also significantly developed my
                              personal skills. I learned the importance of
                              effective communication, teamwork, and critical
                              thinking, and participated in activities that
                              enhanced my presentation and public speaking
                              skills. This program helped me build a strong
                              foundation in Information Technology, along with
                              the development of soft skills, which I consider
                              to be an essential part of my academic and
                              professional success.`,
